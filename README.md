#-AI-Image-Generation-App

AI Image Generation Application

Overview

Developed a full-stack web application inspired by DALLE.AI, a text-to-image generator.
Utilized the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to build a scalable and responsive web interface.
Integrated the OpenAI API for generating images based on textual prompts.

Features

Text-to-Image Generation: Utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images based on user-provided textual prompts.
Responsive UI: Designed with React.js to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface across devices.
Backend API: Implements Node.js and Express.js for backend API development, handling requests securely and efficiently.
Database: Stores application data using MongoDB for scalable and efficient data management.
Deployment: Deployed on cloud platforms for scalability, with version control managed through Git/GitHub.

Usage

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies with npm install.
Set up environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key) in a .env file.
Run the development server with npm start.
Access the application at http://localhost:3000 and start generating images!
